☄︎ Now

Often marveling at the way dappled light meets walls on sunny afternoons.
Thankful for family and friends.
Needing constant reminders that
--> You cannot just love someone and not deliver. 
Taking out the trash every day.

Going to school again.
Adjusting to life where a normal has never been.
Getting to know tools.
