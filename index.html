				it’s nearing the end of August. between looking for jobs and trying to stay off social media to focus on learning web dev i’ve been scheming to get some projects moving.
			</p>
			<p>
				i want to train myself to stop checking for activity on neocities; to that end i’ve committed to <a href="https://tortlegrafix.neocities.org/">a personal website</a> where i follow no one and can make all the updates to my heart’s content. 
			</p>
			<p>
				there’s also <a href="https://zlnrbqb.neocities.org/">ZLNRBQB</a>, a project Kehuan and I are <a href="https://www.are.na/leslie-liu/zine-8z_q45ftdjo">gathering</a> visuals for. it’s been difficult syncing up schedules, but there’s a call for collaborators I need to flesh out and double check with her on.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to design some containers for essays from 2021 — specifically the one about Subway Surfers TikToks, and another for cosplay gestures as exploitable meme format (though I’m not too satisfied with the quality of the writing)
			<p>
				the last major thing is adding alt text to my portfolio — I’m pretty happy with how it’s shaped up so far.

				I’ve been reading about conservatism and I want to start <em>Metaphors We Live By</em> after I finish this current title. Before 2022 ends I want to have made some compositions for musicians whose work I admire. Maybe I should also pick up Blender, or Touchdesigner.
