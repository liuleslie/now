			<p>the latest dispatch, as of the last few minutes of September, 2022:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>October: proverbial adulting officially kicks off</li>
				<li>I have until January (or at the extreme, February) to finish my font/typeface</li>
				<li>in November there is a book fair that a friend and I are scrambling to get stuff made for</li>
				<li>I am seldom thinking about TV dinners, though I do intend to learn about shaders so my thesis doesn't end up dusty and abandoned</li>
				<li>I am still negotiating my various online abodes</li>

				<span class="unsure">I’ve been reading about conservatism and I want to start <em>Metaphors We Live By</em> after I finish this current title.</span> Before 2022 ends I want to have made some compositions for musicians whose work I admire. Maybe I should also pick up Blender, or Touchdesigner.
